# Face-Detection-Using-Mediapipe-Face_Alignment

This project involves utilizing an open-source face detection pipeline, such as 'face-alignment' or 'MediaPipe Face Detection,' to process a given video and identify faces within it. Following this detection process, the faces must be cropped and extracted from their original frames, ultimately creating a new video containing only the isolated faces. This final video, showcasing the detected faces, should then be saved as an output file, necessitating a proficient understanding of programming, video processing, and the chosen face detection library's APIs for successful implementation.
